# Shopping App

Shopping App is my solution to the Webdev Challenge. Prior to the challenge, I have dedicated hours to studying Web development technologies daily since February. Along the line, I got stuck in *tutorial hell* and I have been trying to break away from it for months now. For me, this is more than just a challenge. It is an opportunity for me to put to use everything I know (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass and Angular).

## Features 

The app is a Progresive web application, is responsive and is accessible as it is built with the Web Content Assessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
Users are able to:
-Add items to their shopping list
-Mark an item as purchased
-Undo marking an item as purchased
-Update an item name, price or quantity
-Delete an item
-Clear all items at once

## Stack

For this project, I used the following:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JavaScript
4.IndexedDb/Dexie for storage
5.Workbox for service worker generation
