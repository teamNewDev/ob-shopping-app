# Oja

Oja is my solution to the Webdev Challenge. Prior to the challenge, I have dedicated hours to studying Web development technologies daily since February. Along the line, I got stuck in *tutorial hell* and I have been trying to break away from it for months now. For me, this is more than just a challenge. It is an opportunity for me to put to use everything I know (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass and Angular).

## Features 

The app is a Progresive web application, is responsive and is accessible as it is built with the Web Content Assessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
Users are able to:  
-Add items to their shopping list  
-Mark an item as purchased  
-Undo marking an item as purchased  
-Update an item name, price or quantity  
-Delete an item  
-Clear all items at once  

## Stack

For this project, I used the following:  
1.HTML  
2.CSS  
3.JavaScript  
4.IndexedDb/Dexie for storage  
5.Workbox for service worker generation
